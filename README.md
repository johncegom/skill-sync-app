# SkillSync – A Role-Based Learning Tracker

SkillSync is a **learning-driven React project** designed to help developers grow from **Junior Technician (JT)** to **Senior Technician (ST)** level by building progressively in real-world frontend scenarios.

This project is structured in **three phases**, each one aligned with specific skill checklists (JavaScript Core, Advanced, React, and Layout/Design).

> 📘 The full progressive roadmap is documented in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).
